# React I

Your project assignments are going to be more open-ended than your other assignments.  Your job is to take the material that you've learned and apply it to something that you have total creative ownership of.

## Assignment

Build your homepage using React and `create-react-app`.  You will eventually have multiple pages within your application so this will be the first landing page that a user will hit when they go to your domain.

* Run `create-react-app <project name>` to build your application.
* Create React components to build out the structure of your page.
* Style the components to make your page look nice.

## Bonus

* Make your page responsive with media queries.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries
